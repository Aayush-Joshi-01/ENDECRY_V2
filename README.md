# ENDECRY - File Encryption and Decryption Tool

## Introduction

ENDECRY is a Java-based program designed for secure file encryption and decryption using the SHA-512 algorithm. This tool allows users to encrypt various file types, such as text documents, images, and videos, ensuring data confidentiality and security. ENDECRY has been converted into an executable (EXE) file using Launch4j, enabling easy deployment on Windows machines without requiring Java installation.

## System Requirements

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or higher
- Windows operating system (for running the EXE file)

## Installation

1. Download the ENDECRY executable file from the project's repository.
2. Extract the files to your desired location on your computer.
